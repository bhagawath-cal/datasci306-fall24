## Today's Topic


After today's lecture you will understand:

* Conditional statements: if/else
* Iteration: for/while loops.
* Map family functions

This corresponds to Chapter 26/27 of your book

## Conditional execution
Often when writing functions we need to do different things depending on what data is passed in. This is known as conditional execution, and is accomplished using the if and/or else construct:

<pre>
if (condition) {
  # code executed when condition is TRUE
} else {
  # code executed when condition is FALSE
}
</pre>

## if statements
The workhorse for conditional execution in R is the `if` statement.

```{r}
if (T) {  # this condition is hard-coded to TRUE and will always execute the if-block
  print('do something if true')
}
```

```{r}
x = 1
if(x > 2){
  print(x)
}
print('hello')
```

## Optional else block
Use an else to control the flow without separately checking the condition’s negation:

```{r}
if ((2 + 3) == 5 ) {
  print('the statement is true')
} else {
  print('the statement is false')
}
  
```

## if-else chain

For more complex cases, you may want to check multiple conditions:

```{r}
a = -1
b = 1

if (a * b > 0) {
  print('Zero is not between a and b')
} else if ( a < b ) {
    smaller = a
    larger = b
} else {
    smaller = b
    larger  = a
}

c(smaller, larger)
```

## Function with multiple return example

This function returns 'fizz' if the given number is a multiple of 3. 'buzz' if it is a multiple of 5. If neither a multiple of 3 or 5, it simply returns the given number

```{r}
fizzbuzz <- function(x){
    if(x %% 3 == 0) {
      return ('fizz')
    } else if(x %% 5 == 0){
      return ('buzz')
    }
    return (x)
}

fizzbuzz(7)
```

## Iteration
Sometimes, you want to repeat a set of statements again and again... until a conditional is met. That is when you use a `for` loop

<pre>
{r}
for (<index> in <vector>) {
    [do something for each value of <index>]
}
</pre>

```{r}
x = sample(1:100, 10, replace = F)
print(x)
for (item in x){
  print(item)
}
```

## Exercise

Print the values that are even numbers in this vector using a `for` loop (not vector operation)
```{r loop-1, exercise = TRUE}
x = sample(1:100, 10, replace = F)

```

```{r loop-1-solution}
x = sample(1:100, 10, replace = F)
x
for(item in x){
  if(item %% 2 == 0){
    print(item)
  }
}
```

## `while` loop
The last kind of loop we will consider is `while()`.

A while statement can be useful when you aren’t sure how many iterations are needed. This happens sometimes in statistics or data science when you are simulating a random quantity.

Here is an example that takes a random walk and terminates if the value is more than 10 units from 0.

**Example: random walk**
A random walk is a mathematical concept that describes a path constructed by a series of random steps. The concept of random walk has numerous applications in computer science, offering a powerful tool for modeling complex systems, designing algorithms, and analyzing data.

```{r}
maxIter = 1000 # always limit the total iterations allowed
val = c()
val[1] = rnorm(1) ## initialize
val[1]

k = 1
while (abs(val[k]) < 10 && k <= maxIter) {
  val[k + 1] = val[k] + rnorm(1)
  k = k + 1
}
val = val[1:k]

plot(val, type = 'l')
```

## loop keywords

The following key words are useful within loops:

* break - break out of the currently executing loop
* next - move to the next iteration immediately, without executing the rest of this iteration (continue in other languages such as C++)

Here is an example using next:
```{r}

for (i in 1:10 ) {
  if (i %% 2 == 0) next
  cat(i,'\n')
}
```

`break` example

```{r}
maxIter = 1000 # always limit the total iterations allowed
val = c()
val[1] = rnorm(1) ## initialize

k = 1
while (k <= maxIter) {
  val[k + 1] = val[k] + rnorm(1)
  k = k + 1
  if(abs(val[k]) > 10)
      break
}
val = val[1:k]

plot(val, type = 'l')
     
```

## Dataframe functions
A case of a problem of indirection, as `dplyr` uses `tidy evaluation` to allow you to refer to the names of variables inside your data frame without any special treatment.

```{r embrace, exercise = TRUE}

grouped_mean <- function(df, group_var, mean_var) {
  df |>
    group_by(group_var) |>
    summarize(mean(mean_var))
}

grouped_mean(mpg, model, hwy)
```

Fix with embracing `{{ }}`




## `map` functions

An alternative to writing a `for loop` is to use the map(f, seq) function. This takes a function f and "maps" it over each element of a sequence (list or vector) seq.

## Compound Random Variables

Many times we take sample sizes $n$ to be fixed. But what if our sample size itself was random? 

A **compound random variable** is one in which a discrete random variable sets the sample size, and then some other random variable is replicated that many times.

```{r}
r_pois_norm <- function(n, mu = 0 , sd = 1) {
  replicate(n, {
    # generate a random integer between 8 and 10
    n_i <- sample(8:10, 1)
    rnorm(n_i, mu, sd)
  })
}

samples <- r_pois_norm(3)
samples
```


## Maximum of the samples

What was the largest value of each sample?

```{r}
map(samples, max)
```

What was the largest magnitude?
```{r}
## version 1
map(samples, ~ max(abs(.x)))
```
Recall: `~ ... operations on .x ...` is equivalent to 
```{r eval = F}
function(.x) { ... .x ...}
```

```{r}
get_max <- function(x){
  max(abs(x))
}

map(samples, get_max)

```

```{r}
## version 2
map(samples, abs) |> map(max)
```

## Exercise

Use `map` to square (raise to the power of 2) each number in the list.

```{r mapclass, exercise = TRUE}
v = c(2, 4, 5, 7)

```

```{r mapclass-solution}
map(v, ~ .x^2)

#OR

pow_2 <- function(x){
  x ^ 2
}

map(v, pow_2)
```

## Exercise

Use `map` that takes `flights` dataframe and:

* Return a short summary in the form of the mean, median, and standard deviation if it is `numeric`.
* Return the class of the object otherwise


```{r mapsummary, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r mapsummary-solution}
map(flights, ~ summary(.x))
```

## Getting vector outputs

`map` can take either a list or a `vector` as input, but always returns a `list` as output. If you know that all outputs will be the same, you can `unlist` to get the values in the form you want:

```{r}
map(samples, ~ max(abs(.x))) |> unlist()
```

## Known types

If you know that all of the entries in the list will be of a particular type, you can `flatten_*` them to that type:

- `dbl`: Numeric data, decimal (can handle integers too)
- `int`: Numeric data, integers
- `lgl`: Logical/boolean
- `chr`: Character/strings 

```{r}
map(samples, ~ max(abs(.x))) |> flatten_dbl()
```

You get an error if things don't match:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
flatten_dbl(list(c("hello")))
# Error: Can't coerce element 1 from a character to a double
```

## `map_*` versions

The pattern `map(input, f) |> flatten_*()` is so common, there are parallel versions for map:

```{r}
map_dbl(samples, ~ max(abs(.x)))
```



## Additional arguments

We have seen several times that R functions take `...` and can use that to pass additional arguments along  to other functions.

```{r}
samples_missing <- samples
samples_missing[[1]][1] <- NA

map_dbl(samples_missing, mean)
map_dbl(samples_missing, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Mapping on two things

Suppose for each sample, we have another outcome:

```{r}
samples_y <- map(samples, ~ runif(length(.x)))
samples_y
```

What is the correlation within each sample?

```{r}
map2(samples, samples_y, cor)
map2_dbl(samples, samples_y, cor)
```


## Mapping your own function on two things

Suppose we wanted the average ratio of X to Y within each sample. We need to write a custom function with two arguments:

```{r}
map2_dbl(samples, samples_y, function(x, y) { mean(x / y)})
map2_dbl(samples, samples_y, ~ mean(.x / .y))
```

## Exercise

Using `map2`, get the first word of each item in `stringr::fruit` (keep single words). 

Some useful examples:
```{r}
str_locate("chili pepper", " ")
str_sub("chili pepper", end = 6 - 1)
str_locate("canataloupe", " ")
```


```{r firstword, exercise = TRUE}
first_space <- str_locate(stringr::fruit, " ")[,1]
```

```{r firstword-solution}
first_space <- str_locate(stringr::fruit, " ")[,1]
get_word = function(x, y){
  if(is.na(y)){
      return(x)
  }
  return(str_sub(x, 1, y-1))
}
map2(fruit, first_space, get_word) |> flatten_chr()

fruit
```



## Other loop replacing functions

`keep` takes only the entries that match a predicate:

```{r}
keep(samples, ~ length(.x) > 10)
```

`discard` drops entries that match.

Many `for` loops have **accumulators**:

```{r}
max_length <- -Inf
for (i in seq_along(samples)) {
  max_length <- max(length(samples[[i]]), max_length)
}
max_length
```

`reduce` avoids the bookkeeping (often convenient to map first):
```{r}
map_dbl(samples, length) |> reduce(max)
```


```{r}
reduce(c(1, 10, 100, 2, 3, 4), `+`)
```

We can see the intermediate results with `accumulate`:

```{r}
accumulate(c(1, 10, 100, 2, 3, 4), `+`)
```

## Map functions that return tables

The `_dfr` variants use functions that return data frames, and then row bind them together
```{r}
map_dfr(samples, ~ tibble(x = .x))
```
We probably want to know which sample each value is so we can do operations after. We can use an **indexed map** with the `imap_*` variants:
```{r}
imap_dfr(samples, ~ tibble(x = .x, sample_num = .y)) |> 
  group_by(sample_num) |> 
  mutate(x_centered = x - mean(x)) # within group, mean centered values
```

There is also `_dfc` that binds columns together.




## Built in R functions

There are several built in functions that are similar to `map_*`:

* `lapply` is similar to `map`, but doesn't allow for the function shorthand notation
* `sapply` is similar to the `map_*` varieties, but no checking. Will return a list if it can't safely unlist results.
* `vapply` is even closer to `map_*`, but still no anonymous functions
* `mapply` is similar to `map2`

R also has some capitalized versions (`Map`, `Reduce`), but generally no checking less convenient to use with pipes.

## Errors in iteration

If we run into a bug in the code being iterated, it can often be difficult to find the source.

```{r}
x <- list(1, 10, "3", 7)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- list(1, 10, "3", 7)
map(x, log)
# Error in .Primitive("log")(x, base) : 
#  non-numeric argument to mathematical function
```

The `safely` function catches these errors and gives back useful info:

```{r}
safe_log <- safely(log) # returns a new function
safe_log(10)
safe_log("3")
map(x, safe_log)
```
